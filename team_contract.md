# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** We will meet at minimum once a week on Wednesdays at 1:00pm. We will hold the meeting on Zoom and communicate in between asynchronously through Discord. We will take turns writing a short summary of the meeting and pushing it to a development log on Github.

2. **Assistance** We will communicate about recieving and giving help through our Discord group chat. We expect each other to respond within the day. 

3. **Respect** At the beginning of each weekly meeting, we will each share what we've been working on and any ideas we might have for the project or for each other. If we notice someone is not listening or engaging with the conversation, we will take action as per our conflict resolution policy.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** We will assign workload based on the goals we plan to meet for each week at our Zoom meeting. If there are any unexpected complications, we will communicate with our other group members via Discord and discuss whether someone else has time to help complete the task for that week. When distributing work, we will let people discuss what tasks they want to complete based on what is necessary for that week.

5. **Time Commitment** We will expect 2-3 hours of work per week for each group member. We recognize that multiple members are working on other projects for others classes simultaneously and that there are final exams coming up, so our estimation of time spent per week may vary. If there are time conflicts or new committments for a particular week, then we can discuss among ourselves how to redistribute the work to each other to make up for our limited work capacity.

6. **Conflict Resolution** If a person misses their task goal more than once, then it should be at least discussed to determine if additional support or redistribution of work is required. If a teammate is habitually late, then we should first consider if rescheduling our weekly meetings would be in our best interest. If an issue is consistently recurring and cannot be resolved internally, then our other teammates will contact course staff, such as our group mentor, to step in.
